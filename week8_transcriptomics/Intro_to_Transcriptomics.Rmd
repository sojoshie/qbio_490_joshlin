***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on Brightspace.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In SummarizedExperiment Tutorial, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure and turn it into more readable dataframes, saving them as rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes. In this semi-guided assignment, you will use these dataframes to perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in 490_cluster.
```{r setup}
 knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("/home1/jlin7423/490_cluster/analysis_data"))
```

If DESeq2 is not already installed, install it now
```{r}
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
```

Load in all necessary packages
```{r}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(SummarizedExperiment)


library(DESeq2)
```



*1*
Read in the rna_clinical, rna_genes, and rna_counts dataframes which you made in the "SummarizedExperiment Guided Tutorial" R Notebook

```{r}
rna_clinical <- read.csv('/home1/jlin7423/490_cluster/analysis_data/BRCA_rna_clinical.csv')
rna_genes <- read.csv('/home1/jlin7423/490_cluster/analysis_data/BRCA_rna_genes.csv')
rna_counts <- read.csv('/home1/jlin7423/490_cluster/analysis_data/BRCA_rna_counts.csv', row.names=1)
```


*2*
In this assignment, you will run differential expression analysis comparing patient samples by whether the sample is from a tumor or normal tissue (this is the definition column in rna_clinical). You will need to choose a variable to control for covariance of: age and/or PAM50 subtype (paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50). 

Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?) Filter out genes with a total expression across all patients less than 1000.
```{r}
rna_clinical$age_category <- ifelse(rna_clinical$age_at_index <= 58, 'young', 'old')
rna_clinical$definition <- factor(rna_clinical$definition)
rna_clinical$age_category <- factor(rna_clinical$age_category)

rm_na <- !is.na(rna_clinical$definition) & !is.na(rna_clinical$age_category)
rna_counts <- rna_counts[ ,rm_na]
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[rm_na, ]

rm_meta <- rna_clinical$definition != "Metastatic"
rna_counts <- rna_counts[ ,rm_meta]
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[rm_meta, ]

keep_genes <- rowSums(rna_counts) >= 1000
filtered_rna_counts <- rna_counts[keep_genes, ]
```


*3*
Perform the differential expression analysis, All you need to do is fill in the appropriate # terms
```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = rna_counts,
                              colData = rna_clinical,
                              design= ~age_category + definition)

dds_obj <- DESeq(dds)

resultsNames(dds_obj)

results <- results(dds_obj, format = "DataFrame", contrast = c("definition", "Primary solid Tumor", "Solid Tissue Normal"))

results <- data.frame(results)
```

Prepare results dataframe for EnhancedVolcano plotting. Add two columns, "-log10(padj)" and "gene_name". Fill in these columns appropriately.
```{r}
if (!require("EnhancedVolcano", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")

results$gene_name <- rna_genes$gene_name
results$'-log10(padj)' <- -log(results$padj, 10)
```

*4*
Now we will use the EnhancedVolcano package to plot our results. The code is already completed and should run without adjustment if all code up to here is correct.
```{r}
EnhancedVolcano(results,
                lab = results$gene_name,
                x = 'log2FoldChange',
                y = '-log10(padj)',
                title = 'Sample Definition: Tumor vs Normal Tissue',
                pointSize = 1.0,
                labSize = 5.0)
```

# Explain what genes from each part of the Volcano Plot mean in terms of their significance and up/down regulation. 
top-right genes: Statistically significant + upregulated (Log2FC > 1)
bottom-right genes: Not statistically significant but upregulated (Log2FC > 1)
top-left genes: Statistically significant + downregulated (Log2FC < -1)
bottom-left genes: Not statistically significant but downregulated (Log2FC < -1)
top-middle genes: Statistically significant but neither upregulated nor downregulated (|Log2FC| < 1)
bottom-middle genes: Neither statistically significant nor upregulated/downregulated (|Log2FC| < 1)

Save the picture of the volcano plot (using either ggsave() or right clicking and manually downloading the image and push this .Rmd and the image to GitHub)
